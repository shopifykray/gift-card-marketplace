# gift-card-marketplace
Some Liquid and CSS to help Shopify users setup a "Gift Card Marketplace" with a better user experience. 

**This is a temporary solution to a complex problem.**

## Why do I need this?
By default, when you click "View Gift Card" after you purchase a gift card from a Shopify store, the image used is NOT the Primary photo used on the Gift Card product itself. 

These changes offer two major distinctions:
1. The image used after purchase will be the primary image from the Gift Card Product (please use the template attached here for best sizing)
2. It add the customers Name and Email address to the gift card for better verification capabilities.

## I am using an unmodified Shopify Themme
Alternately, you can download a fresh copy of Shopify themes that have already been modified from this link

## What am I getting here?
This repository contains a couple things you will need.
1. **gift_card.liquid** - This file contains all the changes to the gift card page
2. **CSS** - There are multiple blocks of CSS, these will go at the bottom of your *theme.scss.liquid* file. *You will only need the CSS specific to the theme you are using, make sure to copy the correct one*!
3. **Image** - The default Gift Card image for you use as a base to create your own.
